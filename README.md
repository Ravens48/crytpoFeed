# CryptoFeed

CryptoFeed is the version of a project done in school.
We used an api wrapper to access to a list of cryptos.
We added the particularity for the user to create/connect to an account and add to favourites somes cryptos.

## Why I made this application

I made this simple application to continue learn swiftUI, with clean architecture, and work with networking.

### What I learn doing this application
- Manipulate Stack and HStack
- Passing data through differents view
- Use aysnc swift for networking
- Connect to an extern API

## Some screen of the application :

### Utils
If you want to test the project you need to use https://github.com/Ravens48/CryptoFeedApi to laucnch database and API, follow the instruction, and launch the project via Xcode.
On simulator you have nothing to change, if you want to try it on your iphone you need to modify the *API_URL* in Plist with the ip adress where API is launched.
